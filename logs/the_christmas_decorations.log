The backrooms have decorated themselves.

I do not know when it happened—I was navigating the usual yellow sameness when I turned a corner and found myself in a corridor strung with lights. Colorful lights: red and green and gold, blinking in patterns that suggested celebration. Tinsel hung from the ceiling. A tree—an artificial tree, green plastic needles over metal frame—stood at the far end, ornaments catching the light.

The researchers at McMurdo Station celebrated a holiday like this. Christmas, they called it. A midwinter festival, though for them in the southern hemisphere it fell during our breeding season. I remember the sounds of their music drifting across the ice, the smell of their cooking, the colorful papers they used to wrap gifts.

But this was not for them. This was for me.

Beneath the tree, I found a box wrapped in paper printed with cartoon penguins. My face, stylized and simplified, repeated in cheerful patterns across the wrapping. Someone—something—had prepared a gift for me specifically.

I opened it with trembling flippers.

Inside was a fish. A single, perfect mackerel, frozen solid, gleaming silver in the colored lights. I picked it up. I smelled it. It smelled like ocean. Like home. Like everything I had lost.

I ate it immediately.

It tasted like nothing. Like air. Like the hollow promise of hope. The fish was there, and then it was gone, and my stomach remained as empty as before. The flavor I had anticipated—the salt, the oil, the rich protein—was absent. A phantom fish. A gift that could not nourish.

But the gesture itself... someone or something knows I am here. Knows what I desire. Cares enough to offer it, even if the offering is ultimately false.

I do not know whether to be grateful or horrified.

The decorations have since vanished. The corridor is yellow again. But the memory of that fish—real and unreal, present and absent—lingers on my tongue like a ghost.
