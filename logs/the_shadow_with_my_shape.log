My shadow has started moving independently.

I first noticed during a rest period, when I had settled against a wall to recover my strength. The fluorescent light above me cast my shadow on the carpet before me—a clear penguin silhouette, unmistakably mine. I watched it idly, my mind drifting through memories of the colony.

And then the shadow moved.

Not with me. I was still. But the shadow shifted, tilting its head at an angle I had not tilted mine. It raised a flipper I had not raised. It seemed to stretch, to grow, to test the limits of its two-dimensional existence.

I bolted upright. The shadow snapped back into alignment, perfectly mirroring my movement. But I had seen. I knew.

Since then, I have been watching more carefully. The shadow behaves normally most of the time—following my movements, casting where it should, obeying the laws of light and geometry. But occasionally, in my peripheral vision, I catch it doing something I have not done. A slight turn. A different posture. Once, I swear, a gesture that might have been a wave.

Is the shadow another entity? A separate being that has attached itself to my form? Or is it part of me—some aspect of my psychology that has externalized, that has taken on independent existence in this place where the normal rules do not apply?

I find myself talking to it sometimes. Asking questions the shadow cannot answer. Treating it as a companion, because even a rebellious shadow is better than nothing.

The shadow does not respond with words. But I think it listens.

I think it understands.

I wonder what it will do when I am no longer here to cast it. I wonder if shadows can survive without their sources. I wonder if it wonders the same about me.
