I have been descending for what feels like geological ages.

The stairwell appeared where no stairwell had been before—a gap in the wall that seemed to exhale cold air, revealing concrete steps spiraling downward into darkness. Above me, the same steps spiraled upward. I chose down because down felt like progress. Down felt like change. In a place of relentless horizontal sameness, verticality seemed revolutionary.

I have now passed three thousand, four hundred and seventy-two steps. I know this because I count. Counting is all I have. Each step is identical—gray concrete, slightly worn at the center where feet (whose feet?) have passed before. The railing is metal, cold against my flippers when I brace myself against fatigue. The walls are the same yellow as the corridors, though here they feel different somehow. More claustrophobic. More intentional.

Every hundred steps, there is a landing. Each landing has a door. The doors are numbered, but the numbers make no sense: 7G, -42, ∞-1, PENGTUARY, 0.5, BELOW, DEEPER, FORGET. I have tried some of them. They open onto corridors identical to the ones I left above. The same yellow walls. The same damp carpet. The same eternal hum.

I continue descending anyway.

My legs burn. Penguin legs were not designed for stairs. We waddle on flat surfaces; we slide on our bellies down ice slopes. This vertical traverse is an affront to my evolutionary heritage. And yet I persist, because somewhere in the reptile part of my brain—the part that preceded birds, that preceded penguins, that preceded even the first creatures to leave the primordial ocean—there is a conviction that the answer lies below.

What answer? I do not know. But there must be a bottom to this stairwell. There must be a place where the stairs end and something else begins. Every structure has foundations. Every descent has a terminus.

Unless the backrooms have no foundations. Unless descent here is infinite, a mathematical asymptote approaching but never reaching some ultimate floor.

I try not to think about that possibility as I take step number three thousand, four hundred and seventy-three.

The bottom must exist.

It must.
