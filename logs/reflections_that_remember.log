>> THOUGHT TRANSMISSION BEGIN >>

The mirror corridor is wrong in ways I am still trying to articulate.

I discovered it by accident, turning down what I thought was an ordinary passage only to find myself surrounded by reflections. Floor-to-ceiling mirrors lined both walls, stretching ahead of me into infinity—my own image repeated countless times, growing smaller and smaller until it dissolved into the distant perspective point.

At first, I was simply startled to see another penguin. Then I recognized myself. The familiar pattern of my markings, the particular tilt of my head, the way my flippers hung at slightly different angles due to an old injury from a leopard seal encounter in my youth. It was me. Reflected infinitely. Alone in a way that made the singular loneliness of the corridors seem almost companionable.

I waddled forward, watching my reflections waddle in unison. The synchronization was perfect. Every movement replicated exactly, simultaneously, across all visible iterations of myself. This was as expected. This was how mirrors worked. I began to feel almost comforted by the regularity of it.

And then I blinked.

My reflection did not blink with me. Or rather, most of my reflections blinked, but one—seven mirrors deep on the left side—did not. Its eyes remained open, watching me, while I watched it.

I froze. My reflections froze. All except that one, which continued to observe me with an expression I could only describe as curious. It tilted its head—a motion I had not made. It raised one flipper—my flippers remained at my sides. It was no longer reflecting. It was acting independently.

"Hello?" I called out, my voice cracking from disuse. (Had I spoken aloud at all since arriving here? I could not remember.)

The independent reflection did not respond. It simply continued its slow, investigative movements, examining me as I examined it. After a long moment, it turned and waddled away—deeper into the mirrors, into a corridor that I could not enter because the glass stood solid between us.

I left the mirror gallery quickly. I have not returned. I am documenting this for one reason: if my reflection has become something separate from me, something with its own will and trajectory through this place, then I am perhaps not as alone as I believed.

Whether that thought is comforting or horrifying, I have not yet decided.
