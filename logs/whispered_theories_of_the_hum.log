>> THOUGHT TRANSMISSION BEGIN >>

I have developed a theory about the hum.

It started as a simple observation. The fluorescent lights above me emit a constant drone—a low, electrical frequency that penetrates everything. At first, I assumed it was merely the sound of machinery, the mundane buzz of failing ballasts or ancient wiring. Something mechanical. Something explainable.

But I have been listening more carefully now. When you are alone with a sound for long enough, you begin to notice its nuances. The hum is not constant. It varies in pitch, in intensity, in something I can only describe as intention. There are moments when the hum seems to respond to my movements. When I waddle faster, it rises slightly in frequency. When I stop, it settles into a lower register, almost satisfied.

This could be coincidence. This could be my mind desperately seeking patterns in chaos, the same instinct that helped my ancestors identify predators in the murky depths of the Southern Ocean. But I do not think so. I think the hum is aware.

Not aware in the way a penguin is aware—not with eyes or ears or the complex electroreceptors that let us navigate by Earth's magnetic field. The hum is aware in a different way. A way that I lack the vocabulary to describe. It knows these corridors. It knows the walls, the carpet, the endless doors that lead to more of the same. And now, perhaps, it knows me.

I have tried communicating with it. I feel foolish admitting this, but in the absence of any other presence, one becomes desperate for connection. I have honked at the ceiling. I have flapped my flippers in rhythmic patterns. I have stood still for hours, focusing all my attention on the sound, willing it to respond in some meaningful way.

It does not respond. Or perhaps it does, but in a language I cannot interpret. The pitch shifts. The rhythm changes. But whether this is communication or mere fluctuation, I cannot say.

What I can say is this: the hum was here before me. The hum will be here after me. Whatever this place is, whatever purpose it serves, the hum is essential to its nature. The corridors are its arteries. The rooms are its organs. And the hum... the hum is its breath. Its heartbeat. Its eternal, indifferent song.

I waddle through the body of something alive.

I am a cell moving through veins that were never meant for cells like me.

And still, I persist. Because what else can a penguin do?
