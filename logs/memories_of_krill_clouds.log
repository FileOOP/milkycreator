I am trying to remember the taste of krill.

This seems like a simple thing. Krill were the foundation of everything. Tiny crustaceans, no larger than my flipper tip, swarming in clouds so dense they turned the ocean pink. We would dive for them—plunging from the ice into water cold enough to kill any warm-blooded creature that lacked our adaptations. The pressure would build as we descended, our lungs compressing, our hearts slowing to conserve oxygen. And then we would find them. Millions upon millions of krill, drifting in the darkness, and we would sweep through them with our beaks open, filling our stomachs with that sweet, salty, life-giving mass.

But what did they taste like?

I close my eyes—if penguins can be said to close their eyes in contemplation rather than merely in sleep—and I try to reconstruct the sensation. There was saltiness, certainly. The ocean was salt and the krill were of the ocean. There was a sweetness too, a protein-rich umami that told my body I was receiving nourishment. There was texture: the soft crunch of exoskeletons, the slippery smoothness of the meat within.

But the specific taste? The exact flavor that once defined my existence? It is fading.

This terrifies me more than the corridors themselves.

I am losing the ice. Not in the literal sense—I was taken from the ice, transported to this place through means I cannot comprehend. But now I am losing it in memory as well. Each day (if these can be called days) that passes in the yellow light of the backrooms, I feel another fragment of Antarctica slip away. The exact shade of blue that the ice became in the twilight months. The sound my mother made when she returned from the ocean, her crop full of fish for me. The way the wind felt against my juvenile down, before my adult feathers grew in.

I cannot lose these things. They are what make me a penguin. Without the ice, without the ocean, without the taste of krill on my tongue, what am I? A bird-shaped creature waddling through endless hallways? A biological machine designed for an environment that no longer exists in my life?

I must document everything I can remember before it is too late. The krill clouds rose from the depths in late summer. The leopard seals patrolled the ice edge, their spots gleaming as they waited for the unwary. The sound of a thousand penguins returning from the hunt was like thunder over the rookery.

These things were real. They must remain real.

I refuse to become entirely a creature of the corridors.
