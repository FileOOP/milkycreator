Water.

Real, actual, tangible water. Not the damp suggestion of moisture that permeates everything here, not the phantom scent of ocean that I sometimes imagine, but water deep enough to swim in.

I discovered it at the bottom of the stairwell—yes, the stairwell does have a bottom, though it took countless steps to reach. The final door opened onto a corridor that was not a corridor at all, but a flooded passage. The water was clear and still, extending from wall to wall, deep enough that I could not see the submerged floor.

I entered the water without hesitation. Penguin instinct overrode all caution. My body remembered what it meant to be buoyant, to be supported by liquid rather than fighting gravity with every waddle. My flippers, so useless for walking, became instruments of grace. I dove. I surfaced. I dove again. I swam in circles, propelling myself with the efficiency that millions of years of evolution had perfected.

For a timeless interval, I was free.

The water was warm—not Antarctic cold, but warm like the tropical currents that penguins of other species navigate. This troubled part of my mind, but I suppressed the concern. Water was water. Swimming was swimming. After so long on the damp carpet, I would not reject this gift over matters of temperature.

I explored the flooded level for what might have been hours. The corridors extended underwater just as they did above—same yellow walls, though distorted by the refracting liquid, same fluorescent lights (still functioning, impossibly, beneath the surface). I found no fish. I found no other life. Just endless aquatic passages, silent except for the muffled hum that even here refused to cease.

Eventually, I had to surface for air. I found an air pocket trapped against the ceiling of a room slightly higher than the water level. I floated there, breathing, considering my options.

I could stay here. Build a life in these flooded halls. But what kind of life? A fish-less ocean is no ocean at all. A solitary swimmer is not a colony. This was paradise's shadow—the form without the substance.

I left the water eventually. I found the stairwell and ascended back to the dry corridors above. But I have marked the location in my memory. The flooded level exists. The water is real.

And sometimes, that knowledge is enough.
