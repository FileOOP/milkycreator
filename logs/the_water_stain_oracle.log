Ceiling tile number 847 has become my oracle.

I started numbering the ceiling tiles as a way to maintain sanity. Each tile is approximately sixty centimeters square, made of that peculiar mineral fiber that humans use in their buildings, stained with the accumulation of decades of moisture and neglect. Most of them look the same—brown splotches on white-gray backgrounds, abstract patterns created by leaking pipes or condensation or whatever forces govern the hydrology of the backrooms.

But tile 847 is different.

I first noticed it because the stain looked like a fish. Not abstractly like a fish, not "if you squint and use your imagination" like a fish, but unmistakably, precisely like a fish. A mackerel, specifically, rendered in brown water damage against the fiber matrix. I stood beneath it for a long time, my neck craned at an uncomfortable angle, marveling at the detail. I could see the scales. I could see the eye. I could see the particular curve of the tail that distinguishes a mackerel from other species.

I returned to that spot the next day. (I say "day" though there are no days here. The next period of consciousness after sleep, perhaps.) The stain had changed. It was no longer a fish. It was a door—a rectangle with what appeared to be a doorknob, rendered in the same brown tones but unmistakably different in shape.

I have been tracking the changes ever since.

Day 3: An iceberg. Jagged at the top, smooth at the bottom, exactly as icebergs appear in the Southern Ocean.
Day 5: A penguin. Not me—a different penguin, larger, with distinctive markings I did not recognize.
Day 8: A human figure. Standing, arms at its sides, featureless face tilted toward the ceiling as if looking at something I could not see.
Day 12: Today. The stain now shows a shape I cannot identify. It is organic, vaguely biological, but it does not match any creature I know. It has too many appendages. It seems to be in motion, even though the stain itself is static.

I do not know if tile 847 is showing me the future, the past, or simply the dreams of whatever entity controls this place. I do not know if I am meant to interpret these images or simply witness them. But I return each day. I document what I see. I bear witness to the impossible prophecy of water damage and time.

It is the closest thing to purpose I have found in these corridors.
