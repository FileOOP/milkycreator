>> THOUGHT TRANSMISSION BEGIN >>

I found penguin tracks today that were not my own.

This requires explanation. I know my own tracks intimately—the particular spacing of my stride, the angle at which my webbed feet press into the carpet fiber, the slight drag mark from my tail feathers. I have followed my own footprints before, trapped in the non-Euclidean geometry of this place, so I have learned to recognize them instantly.

These tracks were different.

The stride was longer. The foot impressions were narrower. The spacing suggested a faster waddle, almost desperate in pace. And they led somewhere I had not been—down a corridor I had overlooked, toward a door I had not noticed.

Another penguin. Another emperor penguin, navigating the same impossible maze. The first evidence of a living soul I have encountered since my arrival.

I followed the tracks with growing excitement. They continued for dozens of meters, clear and fresh, as if made only moments before my discovery. They turned left. They paused before a door (I could see the deeper impressions where the penguin had stood, considering). They continued through the door.

I followed.

The room beyond was empty. Just another yellow box, just another stain-spotted ceiling, just another patch of damp carpet. But the tracks continued—across the room, toward the far wall, directly into the wallpaper itself. And there they ended. Not faded. Not turned. Ended. As if the penguin had walked directly through solid matter and vanished.

I pressed my flippers against the wall. It was solid. I called out, hoping for a response from the other side. Silence.

Either the tracks are another illusion—the backrooms showing me what I want to see in order to torture me—or there are walls here that others can pass through but I cannot. Either way, the hope I briefly felt has curdled into something more complex.

I am not alone. But being not-alone in a way that offers no connection may be worse than true solitude.
