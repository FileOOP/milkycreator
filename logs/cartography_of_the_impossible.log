>> THOUGHT TRANSMISSION BEGIN >>

I have attempted to create a map of this place. The attempt has revealed only the depths of my own futility.

In Antarctica, navigation was instinctive. We possessed magnetoreceptors—biological compasses that allowed us to sense the Earth's magnetic field, to orient ourselves toward the breeding grounds even across hundreds of kilometers of featureless ice. The sun, when it appeared, provided additional reference. The stars, in the long darkness, guided those who knew how to read them.

Here, there is no magnetic field I can detect. The fluorescent lights never change position. There are no stars. There is no sun. There is only the endless repetition of corridors that seem to mock the very concept of navigation.

I tried anyway. I marked my starting point with scratches in the carpet—deep gouges made by dragging my toenails through the damp fiber. I waddled forward, counting steps, turning only at intervals I could remember. Left at one hundred steps. Right at fifty. Straight for two hundred. Another left. I maintained this pattern until my legs ached and my concentration began to fail.

Then I looked for my scratches. They should have been behind me, perhaps four or five hundred steps back, at the origin of my journey.

They were directly ahead.

Not in the place I had started, but in the place I had ended up. The same scratches, with the same depth and pattern, as if the corridor had folded in on itself and delivered me back to a point that was simultaneously my beginning and my end. I stepped over them and continued forward. After another hundred steps, I encountered them again. And again. And again.

The geometry of this place does not obey the rules I understand. Distances are inconstant. Directions are meaningless. The very concept of "location" seems to be a suggestion rather than a fact. I am not moving through space so much as space is moving around me, reconfiguring itself to ensure that I am always exactly where the backrooms want me to be.

I have stopped trying to map. The map would be a lie, and there are already too many lies in this yellow labyrinth.

Instead, I focus on what is true: I am a penguin. I waddle. I document. And somewhere, impossibly far and impossibly close, the ice still exists. It must still exist.

Because if the ice is not real, then neither am I.
