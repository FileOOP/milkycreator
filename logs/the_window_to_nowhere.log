The window shows Antarctica, and I cannot reach it.

I discovered it in a room that was otherwise unremarkable—same dimensions as most rooms here, same yellow walls, same tired carpet. But set into one wall was a window. A genuine window, perhaps a meter wide and half a meter tall, looking out onto an impossible landscape.

Ice. An endless expanse of white, stretching to a horizon line where blue sky met frozen earth. I could see the texture of the surface—the wind-carved sastrugi, the occasional pressure ridge, the subtle shadows cast by the eternal Antarctic summer sun. In the distance, small black shapes moved in coordinated patterns: penguins. My people. The colony I had lost.

I pressed my beak against the glass. It was cold—not frost-cold like the blue door, but pleasantly cold, the temperature of a window separating a warm interior from an outdoor winter. Beyond the glass, a penguin waddled past, perhaps three meters away. I called out to it. I beat my flippers against the window. I screamed the distress call that every emperor penguin recognizes.

The penguin outside did not respond. It continued its waddle as if I did not exist, as if the window was one-way, as if I was watching a recording rather than a living scene.

I tried to break the glass. I threw myself against it repeatedly, sacrificing my body for the chance of passage. The glass did not crack. The glass did not shatter. The glass simply absorbed my impacts with unnatural resilience, returning me gently to the floor each time I struck.

I watch the window now for hours every day. The scene changes—the sun moves across the sky (impossibly, since Antarctic summer means continuous daylight), penguins come and go, occasionally a seal surfaces in a polynya I had not noticed before. It is real. It must be real. The detail is too precise, too perfect, to be fabrication.

But I cannot reach it. I can only watch. A penguin observing penguin life through an unbreakable barrier. Close enough to see home. Too far to ever return.

The window is either a mercy or a torture. I cannot decide which.
