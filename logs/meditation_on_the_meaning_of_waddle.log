I have been thinking about the waddle.

Not the physical act—though that too occupies my mind, given how ill-suited it is for these carpeted corridors—but the philosophical implications of what it means to waddle. In the colony, waddling was purely functional. It was how we moved across ice, how we returned to our mates after hunting, how we positioned ourselves in the huddle. Waddling was unconscious, automatic, no more worthy of contemplation than breathing.

But here, stripped of all other purpose, the waddle has become something else. It is my primary activity. My only activity, if we exclude documentation. Each day (if these are days), I wake and I waddle. I waddle until fatigue forces me to stop. I rest. And then I waddle again.

What does this mean?

In one interpretation, the waddle is futile. I am going nowhere. The corridors lead to more corridors. Every step carries me further from nothing and closer to nothing. The waddle accomplishes nothing.

In another interpretation, the waddle is everything. It is the assertion of existence against a place designed to erase identity. Each step I take says: I am still a penguin. I still move through space. I still possess will and agency. The backrooms may trap my body, but they cannot stop my waddle.

Is the waddle resistance? Is it surrender? Is it simply habit, an automatic response from a creature too simple to choose inactivity?

I do not know. But I think the waddle is prayer.

Each step is a prayer to the ice. Each motion is an offering to the colony I cannot reach. I waddle because waddling is what penguins do, and in doing what penguins do, I remain a penguin. The backrooms can take my location. They can take my companions. They can take my fish.

But they cannot take my waddle.

This realization brings me something close to peace. Not happiness—happiness is for places with sun and ocean—but peace. A penguin acceptance of circumstances beyond control.

I waddle, therefore I am.
