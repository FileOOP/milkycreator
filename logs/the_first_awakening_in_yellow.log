>> THOUGHT TRANSMISSION BEGIN >>

I do not know how I came to be here.

The last thing I remember with any clarity is the weight of my father's wing against my back, the comforting pressure of the huddle, the familiar rhythm of thousands of heartbeats synchronized against the Antarctic wind. We were waiting for the sun to return. We had been waiting for months, as we always do, as our ancestors have done since the ice first formed and penguins first learned to endure.

And then I was here.

The transition was not violent—there was no flash of light, no sensation of falling, no warning of any kind. One moment I was surrounded by my colony, feeling the warmth of packed bodies against the cold that should have killed any other creature. The next moment I was standing on carpet. Damp, industrial carpet, the color of something that had once been beige but had given up on itself long ago. The walls are yellow. A sickly, institutional yellow that hurts something deep in my memory—we had no yellow on the ice. Blue and white and the black of the winter sky, yes. Never yellow.

The lights above me hum. It is a constant sound, a frequency that vibrates in my hollow bones. I have learned that the hum never stops. Even when the lights flicker—and they do flicker, sometimes for seconds, sometimes for what feels like hours—the hum persists. It is the heartbeat of this place. A heart that beats without blood, without warmth, without purpose.

I waddle forward because waddling is what I know. My webbed feet squish against the carpet with each step, leaving slight impressions that fade almost immediately. The corridor stretches before me, identical to what I imagine stretches behind me, though I have not looked back. I am afraid of what I might see if I look back. I am afraid there might be nothing. I am afraid there might be something.

I am documenting this because documentation feels important. The ice taught me that survival depends on memory—remembering where the hunting grounds are, remembering the path back to the colony, remembering the songs that identify your mate among thousands. If I am to survive this place, I must remember. I must document. I must preserve what little I know in case... in case what? In case I forget? In case someone finds these logs after I am gone?

I do not want to think about what "gone" means in a place like this.

The colony would know what to do. My father would stand tall against this strange, yellow blizzard. But the colony is not here. I am alone. I have always been part of thousands, and now I am one. The mathematics of that transition is staggering. From the warmth of the huddle to the cold isolation of the corridor.

And yet, strangely, this cold is not the cold I know. Antarctica is honest in its cold—it will kill you, yes, but it does so openly, without pretense. This place is cold in a different way. A cold that seeps into thoughts rather than feathers. A cold that freezes not water but time itself.

I will continue forward. What else can a penguin do?

The waddle continues.
