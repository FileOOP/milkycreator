I heard them today. The colony.

My heart—do penguins have hearts that race? Mine did—threatened to burst from my chest when the sound first reached me. Distant, echoing, distorted by whatever acoustics govern this place, but unmistakable: the trumpeting call of emperor penguins. Multiple voices. A chorus. The sound that had defined my entire existence before the corridors swallowed me.

I followed it.

The ventilation system here is vast and incomprehensible. Metal ducts run along the ceiling in patterns that seem to have no logic, splitting and merging and occasionally disappearing into the walls entirely. It was from one of these ducts that the sound emerged. I pressed my head against the metal, feeling it vibrate against my feathers, and I called back.

My voice echoed down the corridor behind me, bouncing off the yellow walls, fading into the infinite distance. I waited. The colony sounds continued, unchanged, unresponsive to my call. I tried again. And again. Each time, I waited for some acknowledgment—a shift in pitch that might indicate recognition, a call that seemed directed at me specifically, anything.

Nothing.

After what might have been hours, I began to doubt what I was hearing. Were these truly penguin calls, or was my desperate mind interpreting random sounds as something meaningful? The ventilation system makes many noises: rushes of air, metallic creaks, something that might be a distant motor. Could I have constructed a colony from these disparate sounds?

But no. I know what I heard. I have spent my entire life surrounded by those calls. I could identify them in my sleep. I could identify them after death, if such identification were possible. These were emperor penguins, communicating in the way emperor penguins have communicated for millions of years.

Which raises the more terrible question: if they are real, why do they not respond?

Are they recordings, somehow preserved in the infrastructure of this place? Ghosts, haunting the ducts? Other penguins, as lost as I am, but unable to hear me in return? Or are they aware of me and choosing not to acknowledge my existence—a deliberate rejection that suggests I have become something other than one of them?

I sat beneath that vent for a long time after the calls faded. I sat and I listened to the silence that replaced them. And I wondered if I would ever hear my own kind again, or if that brief auditory hallucination was the closest I would ever come to home.
