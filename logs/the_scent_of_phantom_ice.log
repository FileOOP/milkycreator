For three steps, I was home.

I cannot explain it any other way. I was waddling through a corridor indistinguishable from every other corridor—yellow walls, damp carpet, the omnipresent hum—when suddenly the air changed. The temperature dropped not just noticeably but dramatically, plunging from the tepid staleness of the backrooms to something sharp and clean and achingly familiar.

It smelled like Antarctica.

The scent hit me like a physical force. Brine and wind and the peculiar ozonic freshness of ice that has never known pollution. My feathers fluffed instinctively, responding to cold they had been designed to withstand. My body remembered the sensation even as my mind struggled to process it.

I stopped walking. I stood in that pocket of Antarctic air and I wept. Not figuratively—penguins do not weep figuratively—but actually, the ducts near my eyes producing salt water that should have been used to desalinate ocean intake. The tears froze on my feathers before they could fall. Just like home. Just like home.

And then I took another step, and it was over.

The air returned to its backroom baseline: warm, damp, carrying only the faint electrical tang of the lights and the unidentifiable mustiness of the carpet. The cold vanished as completely as if it had never existed. My frozen tears melted and dripped onto the floor.

I searched for the pocket. I waddled backward, forward, in circles, hoping to find the exact spot where the temperature had dropped. Nothing. The corridor was uniform. There was no cold. There was no ice. There was only the memory of those three steps, burning in my mind like a brand.

I have theories. Perhaps the backrooms contain tears in their fabric, places where other realities bleed through. Perhaps the Antarctic still exists somewhere, separated from me by barriers I cannot see, and occasionally those barriers thin enough to allow a breath of true cold to penetrate. Perhaps I am simply going mad, and my brain manufactured a sensory experience to give me hope.

I choose to believe the first theory. I choose to believe that the ice is still out there, still real, still waiting.

Because the alternative is too cold to contemplate. And I have experienced enough cold for one existence.
