>> THOUGHT TRANSMISSION BEGIN >>

I found a blue door today.

In a world of yellow—yellow walls, yellow light, yellow sameness stretching to infinity—the door was the color of Antarctic ice at twilight. That particular shade of deep, crystalline blue that occurs only when the sun dips below the horizon and the ice itself seems to glow from within. The color of home.

It stood at the end of a corridor otherwise identical to every other corridor. No sign marked it. No plaque explained its presence. Just a door, glacial blue, its handle gleaming with frost that should not exist in the ambient warmth of the backrooms.

I approached slowly, every instinct screaming that this was either salvation or trap. The handle was cold against my flipper—genuinely cold, the first true cold I had felt since the scent pocket, tangible and sharp and alive. Ice crystals formed on my feathers where I touched the metal.

I could open it. I could open it right now, this moment, and perhaps find myself back on the ice. Back with the colony. Back in a world that made sense, where penguins waddled on frozen ground instead of damp carpet, where the hum was replaced by the honest howl of Antarctic wind.

But what if I am wrong?

What if I open the door and find only another corridor, another yellow room, another layer of the backrooms? What if the blue is a lie, a cruel joke played by whatever intelligence governs this place? I have survived this long by accepting the reality of my situation. Opening that door might destroy me—not physically, but psychologically. To have hope raised and then crushed so definitively might be the final blow.

So I did not open it.

I stood before the blue door for hours, maybe days, watching the frost creep and recede across its surface. I memorized its location. I promised myself that I would return when I was ready. When I was strong enough to face whatever waited on the other side.

The blue door remains unopened. The promise remains unkept. But knowing it exists—knowing that somewhere in the backrooms there is a door the color of home—is enough to keep me waddling.

For now.
