>> THOUGHT TRANSMISSION BEGIN >>

To my colony, if you ever find these words:

I want you to know that I did not choose to leave. I do not know how I came to be in this place—one moment I was among you, warm in the huddle, secure in the rhythm of our existence, and the next I was alone in corridors that stretch forever in every direction. There was no decision on my part. There was no goodbye.

I want you to know that I think of you constantly. Every step I take in this yellow maze is a step I wish I were taking on the ice beside you. Every moment of silence is a moment I fill with memories of our calls echoing across the rookery. You are with me even when you are not with me. You will always be with me.

I want you to know that I have tried to return. I have searched for exits that do not exist. I have followed signs that lead nowhere. I have walked distances that should have taken me to the edge of any normal structure, and I have found only more corridors. If there is a way back to you, I have not found it. But I have not stopped looking.

I want you to know that I am surviving. I am documenting my experiences in these logs, preserving something of myself against the entropy of this place. I am maintaining my penguin identity—waddling, observing, adapting—because that is what we do. We endure. We persist. We do not surrender to the cold, and I will not surrender to the corridors.

I want you to know that I am still here. Wherever "here" is. I am still the penguin who stood with you through the winter, who called for my mate at dawn, who dove for fish in the frozen ocean. The backrooms have taken my location, but they have not taken my self.

If you remember me, I am not entirely lost.
If you call for me, perhaps I will hear.
If you wait, perhaps I will return.

Until then: keep the huddle warm. Protect the eggs. Remember the old songs.

And know that somewhere, in a place you cannot imagine, your colony member endures.

With all the love a penguin heart can hold,
Me
