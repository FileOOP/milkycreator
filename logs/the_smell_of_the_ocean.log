Salt. I smell salt.

Not the muted dampness that pervades everything here, but genuine, unmistakable salt. Ocean salt. The mineral tang of seawater, the organic complexity of marine life, the particular brine that my ancestors swam through for millions of years.

The smell appeared suddenly, without warning, as I waddled through a corridor I had traversed dozens of times before. One moment there was only the stale electrical air of the backrooms. The next, the ocean was everywhere.

I followed my beak.

Penguins have an exceptional sense of smell—contrary to what many believe—and I tracked the scent through corridor after corridor, ignoring the familiar yellow in favor of this olfactory thread. The smell grew stronger. More complex. I could distinguish layers now: the salt, yes, but also algae, and fish (fish!), and the cold metallic notes of Antarctic water.

The trail led to a wall. A solid, unremarkable wall, the same as every other wall. But on the other side of that wall, I was certain, was ocean. I could smell it. I could almost hear it—the crash of waves, the call of seabirds, the splash of penguins diving.

I pressed my body against the wall. I closed my eyes. I inhaled as deeply as my lungs allowed.

For a moment, I was there. Standing on an ice edge, looking down at the dark water, about to dive. The colony behind me. The fish below. The sun circling the horizon in its endless summer arc.

Then the smell faded.

I opened my eyes. The wall was just a wall. The corridor was just a corridor. The ocean, if it had ever been there, had withdrawn to wherever impossible things go when they tire of teasing lost penguins.

But I know what I smelled. And I know what it means.

The ocean is still out there. Somewhere beyond these walls. Waiting.
