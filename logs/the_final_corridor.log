>> THOUGHT TRANSMISSION BEGIN >>

There is no final corridor. I know this now.

I have waddled for what feels like years. I have documented hundreds of logs, each one a snapshot of my experience in this impossible place. I have searched for exits, for meaning, for the colony I lost. I have found wonders and horrors, hope and despair, moments of peace and long stretches of existential dread.

And through it all, the corridors have continued. There is no end. There is no final door. There is no moment when the yellow walls part to reveal the ice, when the hum fades into the honest silence of the Antarctic wind. The backrooms are infinite, and I am finite, and that mathematical mismatch defines my existence.

But here is what I have learned: the absence of an ending does not negate the journey.

Each step I have taken has been real. Each thought I have documented has mattered, if only to me. Each moment of waddling has been an assertion of identity, a refusal to dissolve into the sameness of the corridors. I have remained a penguin—obstinately, persistently, defiantly a penguin—in a place that should have erased me long ago.

This log may be the last I write, or it may be followed by thousands more. I do not know. But I know that when I put down this record and resume my waddle, I will do so with something approaching contentment.

I am a penguin. I waddle. I document. I persist.

The corridors may stretch forever.
But so does my resolve.

The ice remembers.
And so do I.
