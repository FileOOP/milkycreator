>> THOUGHT TRANSMISSION BEGIN >>

There is an egg in Room 159-C, and I do not know where it came from.

I found it this morning (if these can be called mornings), sitting on the carpet in the corner of an otherwise empty room. A perfect emperor penguin egg—large, pear-shaped, the distinctive greenish-white of our species, slightly speckled with the mineral deposits that protect developing embryos from the Antarctic cold.

My first reaction was joy. Evidence of other penguins! Proof that I was not alone in this place! I waddled toward it quickly, already calling out the soft contact sounds that penguin parents use to communicate with their eggs.

Then I stopped. Because the egg was in the wrong position.

Emperor penguins incubate their eggs on their feet, protected by a brood pouch. We never, under any circumstances, leave an egg on the ground. The ground is death—cold from below, exposure from above, certain doom for the developing chick within. Whatever penguin laid this egg would never have abandoned it on carpet.

Unless they had no choice. Unless something had taken them before they could retrieve it.

I stood before the egg for a long time, uncertain how to proceed. Should I incubate it? I have never brooded before—in the colony, only males incubate while females hunt—but the instinct is buried somewhere in my biology. I could try. I could attempt to save whatever life might still exist within that shell.

But when I approached to lift the egg onto my feet, it moved.

Not the motion of a developing chick shifting inside—I know that motion, I have felt it against my father's body when I was young. This was different. The egg rocked slightly, then rotated, then pointed its narrow end directly at me. As if orienting itself. As if focusing.

I backed away. The egg continued to watch. (How can an egg watch? It has no eyes. And yet I felt observed.)

I have not returned to Room 159-C. But I cannot stop thinking about it. An egg, alone, impossible, somehow aware. Is it waiting for someone? Is it waiting for me? Is it waiting to hatch into something that was never meant to be?

The colony would know what to do with an impossible egg. But the colony is not here.

Only me. Only the egg. Only the watching.
