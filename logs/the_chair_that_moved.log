The chair moved.

I need to document this carefully, because I am aware of how it sounds. I am a penguin alone in an impossible place, and now I am claiming that furniture is rearranging itself. But I know what I saw. I know what I did not see. And the difference between those two things is what terrifies me.

Room 47-B—I have taken to naming the rooms I encounter, based on the faded plaques beside their doors—appeared ordinary when I first entered. Ordinary for this place, which is to say: yellow walls, damp carpet, fluorescent lighting, and the eternal hum. In the center of the room was a single chair. Metal frame. Fabric seat, the same institutional gray-beige as everything else. It was facing the far wall.

I examined the room for perhaps an hour. (Time is difficult here. I say "hour" but I mean "a period that felt substantial.") I checked the corners for anything unusual. I tested the carpet with my feet. I listened for variations in the hum. Finding nothing of interest, I decided to leave.

But I stopped at the doorway. Something felt wrong. A sensation in my feathers, a prickling awareness that my ancestors used to identify approaching predators. I turned back to look at the room one final time.

The chair was facing me.

It had been facing the wall. I am certain of this. I observed it specifically, noted the way its back was turned toward the entrance. And now its front was oriented directly at the doorway. Directly at me. The seat seemed to invite occupancy. The whole arrangement felt like a question: Will you stay?

I did not stay.

I waddled as quickly as my body would allow, my webbed feet slapping against the carpet with undignified haste. I did not look back. I did not want to see if the chair had followed me into the corridor.

This raises questions I do not want to answer. Is this place alive? Not alive like the hum might be alive—aware in some abstract, environmental sense—but alive in the way that allows objects to move of their own volition? Are there things here that observe me as I observe them? Things that manipulate their surroundings when I am not looking?

Or is my mind deteriorating? Is isolation eroding my ability to perceive reality accurately? Perhaps the chair never moved. Perhaps I simply misremembered its original position. The penguin brain was not designed for this environment. We were shaped by ice and ocean and the rhythms of the Antarctic seasons. Perhaps in the endless sameness of the backrooms, that brain is finally beginning to fail.

I do not know which possibility frightens me more.
