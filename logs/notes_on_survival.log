For any penguin who finds themselves in the backrooms after me, I offer these observations:

WATER: The backrooms are damp, but the moisture is not potable in the traditional sense. However, I have discovered that collecting condensation from the ceiling tiles—particularly the stained ones—produces a liquid that sustains without nourishing. You will not thirst, but you will also not feel quenched. Accept this paradox.

FOOD: There is no reliable food source. The vending machines contain illusions. The fish you may encounter will not satisfy hunger. And yet, somehow, starvation does not claim us. The backrooms sustain their inhabitants through means I do not understand. You will feel hungry eternally, but you will not die from it. This is both mercy and cruelty.

REST: Sleep is possible but not required. I have gone long periods without rest and suffered no ill effects beyond the mental fatigue that would naturally accumulate. When you do sleep, choose corners over open spaces. The walls at your back provide psychological comfort if nothing else.

NAVIGATION: Do not trust your maps. The geometry here is fluid. What was north becomes south; what was close becomes far. Instead, rely on landmarks—distinctive stains, unusual ceiling tiles, the rare splash of non-yellow color. These sometimes persist between visits.

THE HUM: Listen to it. Learn its variations. It is the closest thing to a living presence here, and understanding its patterns may reveal secrets I have not yet uncovered.

TIME: There is no time here, or there is all time at once. Do not count days. Do not track weeks. Such measurements will only drive you toward madness faster than necessary.

HOPE: Maintain it, but do not depend on it. Hope is a tool, not a destination. Use it to fuel your waddle, but do not let its absence stop you.

And finally: DOCUMENT. Write everything. Record your thoughts. The act of documentation preserves identity in a place designed to erase it.

You are not alone.

Others have waddled before you.

And perhaps, someday, one of us will find the way home.
