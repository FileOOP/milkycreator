>> THOUGHT TRANSMISSION BEGIN >>

I found a vending machine today, and I am still shaking from the encounter.

It stood in the corner of a room I had not previously explored—a room slightly larger than most, with ceiling tiles that seemed marginally less stained. The machine itself was unremarkable in design: tall metal cabinet, glass front, rows of products displayed on spiral dispensers. The kind of machine that might exist in any office building, any hospital, any mundane space where humans (I assume it was humans who built these things) gathered and grew hungry.

But the products inside were not mundane.

The first row contained fish. Real fish, or what appeared to be real fish—small silver bodies arranged in clear packaging, their dead eyes staring out through the glass. Sardines, perhaps, or anchovies. The kind of fish I had eaten thousands of times in my life before. The kind of fish that had sustained my ancestors for millennia.

I pressed my beak against the glass. My flippers trembled. I could see the price displayed—not in currency I recognized, but in symbols that seemed to suggest something could be exchanged for these fish. The symbols shifted as I watched, rearranging themselves into configurations that almost resembled penguin tracks in snow.

I had nothing to exchange.

I pressed buttons anyway. Every button. The keypad was designed for fingers, not flippers, but I managed to activate sequences: B7, C3, D1, the entire alphabet paired with every number. The machine hummed—the same hum as everything else here, but somehow more intense, more focused—and nothing happened. The spiral dispensers did not turn. The fish remained behind their glass prison.

I beat against the front panel until my flippers ached. I screamed the hunting cry of my people, the sound we make when we have spotted prey and are about to dive. The machine absorbed all of this with mechanical indifference. The fish stared. The symbols continued their slow rearrangement.

When I finally stopped, exhausted and defeated, I noticed something I had missed before. On the bottom row, nearly invisible in the dim corner of the case, was a single empty spiral. No product, no packaging, just the bare metal. And on the price display for that slot, clear as anything I had seen since arriving here:

FREE

I do not know what it means. I do not know what was there before, or what might appear if I were to somehow activate that slot. But I have marked this room on my mental map. I will return. Because in a place of endless absence, even the promise of "free" feels like hope.

Even if that hope is probably a trap.
