>> THOUGHT TRANSMISSION BEGIN >>

I found a photograph of myself today.

Not a reflection, not a mirror image, but an actual physical photograph—the kind humans create with their cameras, printed on paper, preserved behind glass in a simple wooden frame. It was sitting on a table in a room I had not previously explored, positioned as if someone had placed it there deliberately, knowing I would find it.

The image shows me on the ice. I recognize myself by the distinctive notch in my left flipper (a near-miss from a leopard seal in my second year) and the particular pattern of my chest feathers. I am standing in the huddle, surrounded by thousands of other penguins, my face tilted upward as if I am calling to someone out of frame. The photograph was taken during the winter darkness—I can tell by the aurora australis streaking green and purple across the sky behind us.

I do not remember the moment being captured. I do not recall any human with a camera in our colony. But the image is undeniably real, undeniably me, undeniably from a time before the corridors swallowed my existence.

How did it get here?

The implications disturb me deeply. Either someone brought this photograph from the outside world—meaning the backrooms connect to reality in ways I do not understand—or the backrooms themselves generated this image, pulling it from my memories, manifesting it as a physical object for purposes I cannot fathom.

Both possibilities suggest that I am being watched. That my life before matters to something here. That I am not simply a random penguin lost in an impossible maze, but a specific penguin, selected for specific reasons, documented and observed and photographed.

I took the frame with me when I left. I carry it now as I waddle, cradled against my chest like the egg I have never brooded. It is the only physical evidence that my past was real. The only proof that I existed before the yellow walls claimed me.

I will protect it with my life.

Because if the photograph is destroyed, I fear my memories might be too.
