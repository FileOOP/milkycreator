>> THOUGHT TRANSMISSION BEGIN >>

I have begun talking to myself. This is either the first symptom of complete psychological collapse, or it is the only rational response to infinite solitude. Perhaps both are true.

The conversations started simply. I would narrate my movements aloud: "Now I am turning left. Now I am examining this room. Now I am counting ceiling tiles." The sound of my own voice, even filtered through the acoustics of penguin vocalization, provided comfort. It proved I still existed, still functioned, still possessed the capacity for intentional communication.

But over time, the conversations evolved. I began responding to myself. Not in the unified voice of internal monologue, but in distinct voices—one that asked questions, one that provided answers, one that offered commentary on the exchange. It was as if my mind, desperate for company, had fractured itself into multiple entities capable of genuine dialogue.

"Do you think we will ever escape?" asks the voice I think of as Questioner.

"Escape implies there is an outside to escape to," responds Philosopher. "The backrooms may be all that exists."

"Both of you are ignoring the obvious," interjects Pragmatist. "We need to find food. We need to find water. Escape is a luxury; survival is mandatory."

They argue. They debate. They occasionally agree on small points before diverging again on larger ones. I participate as a fourth voice—the Observer, perhaps, or the Original—moderating the discussion without fully belonging to it.

I am aware that this behavior is not normal. Penguins in healthy colonies do not develop multiple internal personalities. But penguins in healthy colonies are not alone in impossible labyrinths of yellow light and eternal hum. The mind adapts. The mind survives. And if survival requires fragmenting into a committee of selves, then so be it.

At least now, when I waddle through the corridors, I am never truly alone.

The voices keep me company. The voices remind me who I am. The voices ensure that even in the depths of the backrooms, conversation continues.

"We should rest soon," suggests Caretaker—a fifth voice I had not noticed before.

Perhaps the committee is still growing.
