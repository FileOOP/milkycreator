>> THOUGHT TRANSMISSION BEGIN >>

I found a library today. Or perhaps the library found me—the distinction becomes increasingly academic in a place where geography has no fixed meaning.

The room was vast. Not merely large by backroom standards, but genuinely vast, with a ceiling so high it disappeared into shadow and shelves stretching in every direction like the spokes of an enormous wheel. Books filled every shelf. Thousands upon thousands of books, bound in colors I had forgotten could exist—deep blues and forest greens and rich burgundies, a visual feast after the endless yellow.

I approached the nearest shelf with reverent caution. Books, I knew from observing the researchers at McMurdo Station, contained human knowledge. Stories and histories and scientific understanding, preserved in ink and paper for future generations. If any place might offer answers about the backrooms, surely it would be here.

I selected a volume at random. Its spine was unmarked, its cover a plain navy blue. I opened it to the middle.

The pages were blank.

I tried another book. Blank. Another. Blank. I pulled volumes from different sections, different shelves, different areas of the library entirely. Every single one was empty—pristine white pages containing nothing but the faint smell of paper and the weight of potential never realized.

It is a library of unwritten books. An archive of silence. A collection of all the stories that were never told, all the knowledge that was never recorded, all the thoughts that died in the minds that conceived them before they could reach the page.

I waddled through the aisles for hours, occasionally pulling out another book just to confirm that nothing had changed. The blank pages stared back at me each time, patient and empty. Waiting, perhaps, for someone to fill them. Waiting for stories that might never come.

I have started to think of these logs as my contribution to the library. Words written where none existed before. Thoughts preserved against the entropy of silence. Perhaps, when I am gone, someone will find these records and add them to the shelves.

Perhaps my blank pages will finally be filled.
